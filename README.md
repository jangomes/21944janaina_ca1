Requirements Checklist:


[x] - Main Activity (or Launcher Activity)

[x] - Button Links open new Activity

[ ] - Home icon opens Main Activity from back-stack instead of creating newly

[x] - Exit Button finishes the activity and closes the app

[x] - Text is not hardcoded in the layout but is present in "strings" resources xml file

[ ] - Image Assets

[ ] - Images (Raster) are used

[ ] - Vector icons (inbuilt material icons) are used

[ ] - SVG icon is used

Layout and Design:

[x] - All text presented should be clear and legible and should have sufficient contrast (Hint: Dark Gray Text on Dark Blue background is bad)

[x] - All activities should contain ScrollViews to display lengthy content

In Main Activity, 

[x] - Basic details are centered horizontally

[x] - Photo has at least 5dp margin on all sides

[x] - 4 buttons have same length

[x] - Copyright Text, has a small font size, has dark gray color

[ ] - Copyright has a top padding 10dp with a top gray border of 1dp (to separate it out from the main content)

In all 4 extra activities, 

[x] - title row is at the top of the app and does not scroll

[x] - title row has a dark background (and hence white/light colored text and icon)

[x] - button row has 3 buttons (or 2/1 buttons) are present in one row with at least 5dp space in between them

[x] - button row spans full width of the app (i.e. each button's width will be set based on app's width)

[x] - Variable and File Naming conventions are followed

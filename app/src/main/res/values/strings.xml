    <string name="intro">My name is Janaina, I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. I graduated in Architecture and Urbanism in 2018, worked creating projects and helping to manage a residential area. In 2019 I moved to Dublin in Ireland to learn a new language. The change of country made me rethink my life goals and in 2021 I decided to applied to start the Computer Science College at Dorset College. I am currently in my first year of college which lasts three years.</string>
